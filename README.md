# Bookmark Image Browser

Browse through your bookmarked images from direct links, DeviantArt, Instagram, Tumblr, Reddit and Pixiv embedded on the extension page.

I made this for myself a couple of years ago since I bookmark a lot of art references and there was no easy way to browse through them. I made some improvements lately and  thought I might as well publish it.

You can view the extension page by going to the options page of the extension. Then you can browse to a folder and add a bookmark to it for easy access.
